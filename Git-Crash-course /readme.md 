## Git 

There is a hidden folder called 'git' which tells you that our project is a git repo. 

If we want to create a git repo in a new project. we create the folder and initialize the repo using 
`git init` 

```sh
mkdir new-project 
cd new-project 
touch readme.md 
code readme.md  
```

## Cloning 
We can clone three ways: HTTPS, SSH, Github CLI. 

Since we are using Github Codespaces. we'll create temporary directory in our workspace. 

```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp 
cd /workspace/tmp 

```
### HTTPS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jidefal/Github-Examples.git 
```

## Commits 

When we want to commit code we write git commit. 
which will open up the commit edit message in the editor of choice. 

```sh 
Git commit 
```

## Branches 

## Remote 

## Stashing 

## Merging 

## Add 
when we want to stage changes that will be included in the commit. we will use the "." to add 
all possible files. 

```sh 
git add readme.md 
git add . 
```
## Status 

Git status shows you what files will or will not be committed. 

```sh 
git status 
```
## Gitconfig file 

The git config file is what stores your local configurations for git such as 
email, name, editor and more. 

Showing the content of our git config file. 

```
git config --list
```
